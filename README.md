# Powershell
This is where I like to keep all my fun Powershell scripting projects.

Get-RandomURLs
--------------
   ### What is it? 
 
 Get-RandomURLs fun Powershell script/module I put together in order to generate a list of random URLs for use in a Red vs 
 Blue style lab. It uses the same basic principles that are used in Diceware to create random passphrases. 

  ### Usage
    
  1. Download Get-RandomURLs files.
  
    ⋅⋅* Get-RandomURLs.psm1
    ⋅⋅* LongWordList.txt
    ⋅⋅* ShortWordList.txt
  
  2. Move files into your Powershell Modules folder.
  
    $home\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\<Module Folder>\<Module Files>
